## What's NOT Included (By Design)

**Canvas App**: Not packaged because:
- .msapp files are complex and environment-specific
- Power Apps Studio is the practical approach
- Full guide provided in `docs/03_AI_CANVAS_APP_GUIDE.md`

**Power Automate Flows**: Not embedded because:
- Teams Dataverse requires separate flow creation
- JSON templates provided in `solution/Workflows/`
- Quick to recreate using templates

**Sample Data**: Tables are empty because:
- Ensures production-ready deployment
- Evaluation questions should be customized per organization
